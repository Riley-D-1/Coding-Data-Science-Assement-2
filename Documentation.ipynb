    "I want to analyse crypto price data and compare it to other cryptocurrencies. I want the data to display their rises and falls and directly compare them with other cryptocurrency data to see if they influence each other's crashes.

    "My program will access the cryptocurrency data using an API however in order to give the program offline access and access at school it will be using CSV backups. Therefore my program will access the data through the API and the csv of the api response if the API response is successful, this not only allows it to function on the school wifi but also without internet. Coin gecko has well written and clear documentation that should assist me in the creation of the API.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    " Visual learning is the most effective way to learn and my website complies into 1 easy place which you can interact with. It's important because Google's built-in comparison is missing key data and doesn’t have an explanation which can make it difficult. Other websites are decently complicated and can be hard if you don’t know what you're looking for. My design is very simplistic and doesn't require much coding knowledge to run. It also works offline which no other mainstream crypto comparators do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Data:\n",
    " Google's built in crypto comparer is missing a wide range of data. It’s missing 11 out of the top 20 crypto coins, and you have to go onto alternative websites that have too many options. Furthermore crypto can feel otherworldly which is why information about crypto currency and how they work can help those. My simplification helps people to easily understand the data without having pages of information shoved down your throat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stakeholders: Who will benefit from the information you create?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- People interested in crypto but people who don’t know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "- People who want to see the comparison of cyrpto coins and see if they affect each other's prices\n",
    "\n",
    "- People wanting a simplified crypto coin id plotter that has the most common crypto coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use: How can the information you obtain from this data analysis be used for or by those who benefit?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The information can be used to track cryptocurrencies changes, it may give someone a lesson about crypto and help them to understand how it all works and it may help people to gain a better understanding of crypto and convince them to invest or learn more about it. My program is a nice stepping stone into the complicated and confusing world of cryptocurrency. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Privacy and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Privacy of Source: Look at where you are sourcing your data. Outline the data that the source needs to protect and explain their responsibilities in protecting their participant's privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The source needs to protect how their data is being requested and used, it also needs to keep the api keys secure and more importantly as Coin Gecko’s API keys are paid it’s especially important they use a secure payment gateway to protect companies and users credit and debit card information. Coin Gecko also needs to keep users' passwords and login information secure as this contains their emails which could be used to create a phishing scam relating to potentailly forgetting to pau for an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application Data Privacy: What are your responsibilities in maintaining user privacy in terms of this data? Is any data identifiable? Describe your responsibilities If you were to push this application out to the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My responsibilities would include making sure that the website is securely deployed and users data is safe. I would make sure to use a Coin gecko api key (not a demo api key like my code uses) hidden in an secure file for example a .txt  file with a .gitignore to stop it commiting in order to not limit users' interactions because of the free limit. I would potentially create a login system with usernames and passwords to further keep my application secure, I would apply password hashing and encryption if I did do so to keep my users data safe and make sure that even I could not read it. I wouldn't need to worry about the other data as that is publicly accessible via my program and also with Coin gecko.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cyber Security Terms Definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "User authentication- User authentication is a process where the user verifies that they are the person who owns the account/application and this is commonly done with MFA (Multi-factor authentication).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Password  hashing- Password hashing is a way of securing passwords that turns your password into a string of numbers and letters using an encryption algorithm. Password hashing is a way to show not even the website your passwords and personal information.Password hashing also prevents people from losing their accounts in case a cyber attack happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is the process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who doesn’t have a decryption key. An analogy for encryption would be locking your data into a vault which only you can access because you have the key. Encryption is important as only your key can unlock the data which keeps it safe and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A secure program on the web would most likely apply these techniques of encryption, password hashing and user authentication to keep their program secure and keep their user's data safe. Another thing a secure program should have is a Https address as this encrypts all of the data from the user, furthermore depending on the website they could potentially need a captcha or cloudflare authenticator to check that the user trying to access the program isn't a bot or using the website for malicious/sketchy.\n"

    "\n",
    "Calculations:\n",
    "My cleaned pandas file calculates the files it needs to drop and successfully drops the ones that don't align with the set parameters given. The calculations about what columns to drop based on the days are very accurate and have plotted correctly in every functioning test. It is decently accurate in plotting a diverse coin against another diverse coin however this stage could be improved by being able to interact with the plot to zoom in to see tiny changes that appear tiny to another's gigantic jumps in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy:\n",
    "The price information passed to matplotlib is accurate to 5 decimal places, and I'm certain that the API data is accurate as coin gecko is a well known and reputable crypto data supplier and are considered to be reputable and accurate  in the field of cryptocurrency tracking. The program plots this data as accurately as possible however because cryptocurrencies are so diverse some coins appear to straightline where in reality they don't move a s much in value compared to the other cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions:\n",
    "The example plot allows you to draw conclusions based on the data given. In the example provided you can evidently see that Solana actually dips in value at the same time as the binance coin and then rises when binace coin rises. Evidently from the data provided by my matplotlib chart you can see that Solana is influenced by Binacecoins rises and falls in this provided plot. In the plot you are able to clearly address what this program set out to do: see if cryptocurrencies affect one another and in this example we can draw the conclusion that over this time period that these cryptocurrencies did affect each other's values. This information could be used to provide potential crypto investors with the knowledge that in the past Solana and Binace coins have affected each other's value and considers them to judge both values in order to predict crashes or falls in the price of these Coins based on the other's price activity. In order to improve, I would potentially create a predictor that says the liklihood based on past data of these coins affecting each other. However my plot is easy to read and you can draw conclusion pretty easily by looking at the plot and the trends of both lines and see if they alsign.\n"

    "My program ticks all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements and the program works and shows the data. An issue brought up by my peers was an issue with the scaling  in the data visualsation however they do say my program is still understanble and readable. My friends both do say the data could be cleaned more throughly however I disagree and belive that data is cleaned exceptionally well. Both of my peer reviews believe that I meet the functional criteria set. Both of my friends belive I do fine on the data reporting stage. According to my peers I do incredibly well in the non functional requirements my peers say that no one should fail due to my high usability thanks to my detailed readme. The code shows the data clearly and my peers both call it reliable and it works first time. My peers evidently are quite happy with my execution of the non functional requirement and they were both able to use it without my help proving the readme successful in its purpose. I mostly agree with both of my peer reviews and their feedback is helpful if I was to continue developing this program.\n",

It can read the user input great too! With data cleaning it only outputs what it needs to, but internally it could do with a little more cleaning. And with data reporting, it completes without errors the visualisation of the data in the form of a static graph; and so, for the functional requirements it does very well!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the non-functional requirements, the usability is high; if you have a working python and pip, it will probably never fail to install first try due to the basic dependancy requirements, and running the code is simple enough. The code when it errors displays the data pretty clearly to make it easy to debug; exactly as planned! Everything works.\n",

Non functional  and functional requirements are met. The program is easy to use and is very reliable in its execution, nothing to complain about here.
